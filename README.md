Phone Number Matcher
The Phone Number Matcher is a simple Python project that provides a basic phone number validation functionality using regular expressions. This project allows users to input a phone number in a specific format (e.g., "+_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _") and checks whether it conforms to the defined pattern. The regular expression pattern verifies that the phone number starts with a plus sign, followed by 1 to 3 digits, a hyphen, and then 1 to 14 digits. Users can easily customize the regular expression based on their specific requirements.

Usage
To use the Phone Number Matcher, simply run the provided Python script. The user will be prompted to enter a phone number, and the script will indicate whether the entered number is valid according to the specified pattern.

Getting Started
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/phone-number-matcher.git
